Welcome to language_tags's documentation!
=========================================

This Python API offers a way to validate and lookup languages tags.

**Standard**
 | It is based on `BCP 47 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`_ (`RFC 5646 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646>`_) and the latest `IANA language subtag registry <http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry>`_.
 | This project will be updated as the standards change.

**JSON data**
 | See the `language-subtag-registry <https://github.com/mattcg/language-subtag-registry>`_ project for the underlying JSON data.

**Javascript version**
 | This project is a Python version of the `language-tags <https://github.com/mattcg/language-tags>`_ Javascript project.
